What is a chatbot?

   A chatbot is a computer program designed to have a conversation with human beings 
   over the internet. Itâ€™s also known as conversational agents, which communicate and 
   collaborate with human users, through text messaging, in order to accomplish a specific task. 
   Basically, there are two types of chatbots. The one that uses Artificial Intelligence, and 
   another one is based on multiple choice scripts.

Why chatbot?

   Chatbots can be useful in many aspects of the customer experience, including 
   providing customer service, presenting product recommendations and engaging customers 
   through targeted marketing campaigns. If a customer has an issue with a product, she can 
   connect with a chatbot to explain the situation and the chatbot can input that information to 
   provide a recommendation of how to fix the product.

Benifits of Chatbot:

   1. Available 24*7: Since chat bots are basically virtual robots they never get tired and continue to obey 
                      your command. They will continue to operate every day throughout the year without 
                      requiring to take a break. This improves your customer satisfaction and helps you rank
.                     highly in your sector.

   2. Handling Customers: Chatbots on the other hand can simultaneously have conversations with thousands of 
                          people. No matter what time of the day it is or how many people are contacting you,
                          every single one of them will be answered instantly.

   3. Automation of repetitive work: Lets be honest, no one likes doing the same work again and again over brief
                                     period of time. In the case of humans, such tasks are prone to errors.
                                     Chatbots now help automate tasks which are to be done frequently and at the
                                     right time.
